## 📚 What I Studied Today
- normalization 1NF, 2 NF, 3 NF , BCNF, how to know candidate key, functional dependency

---

## 💡 Doubts / Questions
- how to make table in 3nf?

---

## 🧠 Key Insights / Takeaways
-> normalization is a designing technique for database for minimizing the redudancy
-> 1 nf states that the attribute should contain atomic value and not contain multi-valued filed.
-> 2nf states that table should be 1nf and no partial dependency should exist
-> 3nf states that table should 2nd and no transitive dependency meaning non primitive dependency should not determine another non primitive attribute.
-> bcnf states that all non primitive attribute should only determine by candidate key or super key only.
