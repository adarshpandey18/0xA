## ðŸ“š What I Studied Today
- DBMS Topic: [[02 - Introduction to DBMS]] [[03 - File System  VS  DBMS]] [[04 - 2 Tier & 3 Tier Architecture]]

## ðŸ’¡ Doubts / Questions
- What is data data redundancy ?
---

## ðŸ§  Key Insights / Takeaways
-> Redundancy means duplication of data.
-> In 2-Tier Architecture the client layer directly interacts with database layer while in 3-Tier architecture the client layer interacts with application layer (business layer) which process the queries or requests and then it retrieves the data from database server and sends them to client after processing them in desired format. 
-> 2-Tier architecture is less secure than 3rd tier architecture
-> file system has many disadvantages like searching, attributes, concurrency, redundancy, security.
