## Points to Remember

- At sunrise, a man facing **east** will have his shadow behind him (**west**).
- At sunset, **shadows always point east**.
- If a man faces **north** at sunrise, his shadow will be on his **left**; at sunset, it will be on his **right**.
- At **noon**, the sun is directly overhead, so there is **no shadow**.
- The **shortest distance** after moving `x` meters horizontally and `y` meters vertically is:
$\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$
