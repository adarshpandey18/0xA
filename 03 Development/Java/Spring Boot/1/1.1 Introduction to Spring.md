# Introduction to Spring

## Spring Framework

- Spring is a **dependency injection** framework used to make Java applications **loosely coupled**.
    
- Introduced by **Rod Johnson** in **2003**, later acquired by **VMware** in **2009**.
    
- Before Spring, developers used **Java EE**, which required a lot of manual configuration (e.g., setting up the server, database, logging).
    
- Spring makes configuration easier using **XML** or **annotations**.
    
- Spring enables you to build applications from **POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects)** and apply enterprise services **non-invasively** to POJOs.
    
- Supports features like **transaction management**, **security**, **data access**, etc.
    

## Spring Boot

- Introduced in **2014** by **VMware**.
    
- Built on top of the Spring Framework.
    
- Provides an **abstraction layer** over Spring Framework.
    
- Comes with **pre-configured templates**, **default settings**, and **starter dependencies** to reduce boilerplate.
    
- Allows **rapid application development** with embedded servers like **Tomcat**, **Jetty**.
    

## Important Components of Spring Framework

- **Core Container** (Beans, Core, Context, Expression Language)
    
- **AOP** (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
    
- **JDBC** (Data Access/Integration)
    
- **Web** (Web, Servlet, WebSocket, REST)
    
- **Testing** (TestContext Framework, Mock Objects, JUnit/TestNG integration)
    

## IoC Container

In the Spring Framework, the **IoC (Inversion of Control) Container** is responsible for managing application components and injecting dependencies.

The container:

- Creates objects (**beans**)
    
- Holds them in memory
    
- Injects one object into another (**dependency injection**)
    
- Manages their entire **lifecycle** (from creation to destruction)

### Concepts Under IoC

1. **Event-Driven Programming**
    
2. **Dependency Injection (DI)**
    
3. **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)**
