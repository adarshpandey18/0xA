# Spring Boot Web

---

## API

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** defines how different software components should interact with each other. In web applications, APIs are used to allow clients (like browsers or mobile apps) to communicate with the server.

---

## Types of APIs

- **REST API** (Representational State Transfer)
    
- **SOAP API** (Simple Object Access Protocol)
    
- **GraphQL** (optional in Spring Boot via external libraries)
    
- **WebSockets** (for real-time, bi-directional communication)
    

---

## REST APIs

- **Most widely used** in modern web and mobile applications.
    
- REST APIs follow **rules and conventions** for building and interacting with web services.
    
- Operate over **HTTP** and use standard HTTP methods.
    

### Common HTTP Methods:

|Method|Endpoint|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`GET`|`/users`|Retrieve a list of all users|
|`GET`|`/users/{id}`|Retrieve a specific user by ID|
|`POST`|`/users`|Create a new user|
|`PUT`|`/users/{id}`|Update an existing user by ID (full update)|
|`PATCH`|`/users/{id}`|Partially update an existing user by ID|
|`DELETE`|`/users/{id}`|Delete a user by ID|

## Adding Spring Web Support

When using **Spring Initializr**, add the **Spring Web** dependency:

### `spring-boot-starter-web`

Includes the following:

- `spring-boot-starter`: Core starter for Spring Boot.
    
- `spring-web` & `spring-webmvc`: Web & MVC framework support.
    
- `spring-core`: Core features.
    
- `jackson-databind`: Converts **Java objects <--> JSON**.
    
- `spring-boot-starter-tomcat`: Embedded **Tomcat server** with default configuration.
    

---

## SOAP

- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for accessing web services.
    
- Uses **XML** for message format.
    
- Heavier and more rigid compared to REST.
    
- Less common in modern development, but still used in **enterprise systems**.
    

---

## WebSockets

- Enables **full-duplex communication** between client and server.
    
- Useful for **real-time** applications like chat, gaming, or live dashboards.
    
- Spring Boot supports WebSockets using **Spring WebSocket module**.

## Spring MVC Architecture

![[spring-boot-mvc-architecture.png]]

- Follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern.
    
- Helps structure the application for better **separation of concerns**.
    

### Layered Architecture

- **Presentation Layer (Controller)**  
    Handles HTTP requests/responses, authentication, and JSON serialization.
    
- **Business Layer (Service)**  
    Contains **business logic**, **validation**, and **authorization**.
    
- **Persistence Layer (Repository/DAO)**  
    Handles **storage logic**, i.e., database queries.
    
- **Database**  
    Stores the actual application data.
    

---

### Why Use MVC Architecture?

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps each layer focused on a single responsibility.
    
- **Reusability**: Code is modular and easier to reuse.
    
- **Scalability**: Easy to expand and maintain large systems.
    
- **Testability**: Components can be tested independently.

## Spring Boot Web Project Structure

![[spring-boot-web-project-structure.png]]

**Typical flow**:

```
Client --> Controller --> Service --> Repository --> Database
```

- **Data** flows between **Controller ↔ Service**.
    
- **Entity objects** flow between **Service ↔ Repository**.
    
- The **Client is unaware** of the actual database layer.
