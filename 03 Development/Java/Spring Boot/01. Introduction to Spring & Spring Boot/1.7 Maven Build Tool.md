## Maven

- Maven is a **build automation** and **project management tool**  primarily used for Java projects. 
- It plays a crucial role in the development, build, and dependency management of Spring applications, including those using Spring Framework's component scanning and annotation-driven configuration.

## Project & Dependency Management

- Maven provides a standardized way to manage Java projects by defining project structure, dependencies, and build configuration using a declarative **XML-based format** (`pom.xml`).
    
- Developers use Maven to specify project metadata, dependencies, plugins, repositories, and other project-related configurations.
    
- Spring Framework and its various modules (e.g., Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Boot) are managed as dependencies in Maven projects. Developers specify Spring dependencies in `pom.xml` and Maven handles the rest.
    

## Build Automation

- Maven automates the build process, including compilation, testing, packaging, and deployment using predefined build lifecycle phases (e.g., clean, compile, test, package, install).
    
- Maven facilitates the building and packaging of Spring applications into deployable artifacts (e.g., JAR files, WAR files) for deployment in production environments.

## Maven Commands

| **Maven Commands**            | **Description**                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mvn compile`                 | Compiles the project's source code.                                                      |
| `mvn clean`                   | Removes all previous build files from the project.                                       |
| `mvn test`                    | Executes project testing steps.                                                          |
| `mvn install`                 | Deploys packaged WAR or JAR files by storing them in the local repository.               |
| `mvn package`                 | Generates a WAR or JAR file for distribution.                                            |
| `mvn deploy`                  | Copies packaged files to the remote repository for use by other developers.              |
| `mvn spring-boot:run`         | Runs a Spring Boot application directly from the source code without packaging it.       |
| `mvn spring-boot:build-image` | Builds a Docker image of the Spring Boot application using the Spring Boot Maven Plugin. |
