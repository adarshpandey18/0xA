## `pom.xml`

- Maven is a popular build automation tool used in many Java projects. In a Spring Boot project, dependencies are specified in the `pom.xml` file. Maven resolves these dependencies and includes them in the classpath.
    
- Starters like `spring-boot-starter-parent` include a wide range of third-party libraries by default. Spring Boot uses these through auto-configurations to set up and pre-configure libraries automatically.
    
- The `spring-boot-dependencies` BOM (Bill of Materials) includes all known third-party libraries and their versions. This means **you don't need to specify version numbers** for dependencies already managed by Spring Boot.

## What is Auto Configuration

- **Autoconfiguration** is a feature in Spring Boot that automatically configures your application based on the libraries present in your classpath and the properties you’ve defined.
    
- It simplifies setup, so you can focus on **business logic** instead of boilerplate configuration.

## How AutoConfiguration Works

```text
ClassPath Scanning → Configuration Classes → Conditional Beans
```

### 1. Class Path Scanning

Spring Boot scans the classpath for known libraries and classes. Based on what it finds, it triggers specific auto-configurations.

### 2. Configuration Classes

Spring Boot has many `@Configuration` classes, each responsible for configuring a part of your application (e.g., web, data, security).

### 3. Conditional Beans

Each auto-config class uses Spring’s `@Conditional` annotations to decide whether to apply that config:

- Is a class available?
    
- Is a bean already defined?
    
- Is a property set?

## Core Features of Auto Configuration

### Auto PropertySource Registration

When you run your Spring Boot app, it automatically registers up to **17 PropertySources**, including environment variables, `.properties` files, etc.

> `application.properties` overrides OS environment variables. (hierarchy)

### META-INF Magic

Every Spring Boot project includes:

```xml
org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure
```

This JAR holds all the "magic" auto-configuration classes Spring Boot uses.

###  Enhanced Conditional Support

Spring Boot adds extra `@Conditional` annotations to make developer life easier:

- `@ConditionalOnBean(DataSource.class)` → true if a `DataSource` bean is present
    
- `@ConditionalOnClass(DataSource.class)` → true if class exists on classpath
    
- `@ConditionalOnProperty("my.property")` → true if the property is set in config
    

> In short: **Spring Boot is just a smart system of prebuilt configuration classes that trigger if your project meets the right conditions.**

## Spring Boot Internal Flow

### 1. Initialization

- The app starts from a class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which is a combo of:
    
    - `@Configuration`
        
    - `@EnableAutoConfiguration`
        
    - `@ComponentScan`
        

### 2. Application Context Creation

- Spring creates the **ApplicationContext**, which manages your beans and their lifecycle.
    
- It scans classpath, processes configurations, and triggers auto-configurations.
    

### 3. Auto-Configuration

- Based on dependencies and classpath, Spring applies necessary `@Configuration` classes using annotations like `@ConditionalOnClass`, `@ConditionalOnBean`, etc.
    

### 4. Externalized Configuration

- Loads config from:
    
    - `application.properties` / `.yml`
        
    - Environment variables
        
    - Command-line arguments
        
- Defaults can be overridden easily.
    

### 5. Embedded Server Startup (For Web Apps)

- If you're building a web app, Spring Boot auto-configures and starts an **embedded server** (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow).
    

### 6. Lifecycle Callbacks

- Beans are initialized.
    
- `@PostConstruct` and other init methods are executed.
    
- Dependencies are injected.
    

### 7. Application Ready

- Application is fully initialized.
    
- Server is live.
    
- Ready to serve HTTP requests.
