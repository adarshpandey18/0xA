The **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model** is used for the **logical representation of data**. It helps in designing the structure of a database at a high level before implementation.

### **Key Concepts:**

#### **1. Entity:**
- An **entity** is any **object** or **thing** in the real world that has a **distinct existence** (physical or conceptual).
- Examples: `Student`, `Course`, `Employee`, `Department`
- **Notation**: Represented by a **rectangle** in ER diagrams.

#### **2. Attribute:**
- Properties or characteristics of an entity.
- Example: A `Student` has `rollNo`, `name`, `age`.
#### **3. Relationship:**
- A **relationship** represents an **association between two or more entities**.
- Example: A `Student` **studies** a `Course`.
- **Notation**: Represented by a **diamond** in ER diagrams.

> The attributes of relationship is called descriptive attributes.
