##  **What is a Key in DBMS?**

- A **key** is a **column (or set of columns)** in a table.
- It is used to **uniquely identify** each row (**tuple**) in a table.
---
##  **Purpose of a Key**
To ensure that **no two rows** in a table are **identical** for that key.
### **Example: Student Table**
Attributes:
- Name, Age, City, **Aadhar Number**, **Roll No.**, **Phone No.**, **Email ID**
Out of these, some attributes can **uniquely identify** a student:
1. Aadhar Number
2. Roll Number
3. Registration Number
4. Student License Number
5. Voter ID
6. Phone Number
7. Email ID
These are all potential **keys**.

##  **Candidate Key**
A **Candidate Key** is a **minimal set of attributes** that can **uniquely identify** each tuple in a table.
- There can be **multiple candidate keys** in a table.
- Each one is a **"candidate"** to become the **Primary Key**.
###  **Key Points:**
1. **Uniqueness**: Must uniquely identify each record.
2. **Minimality**: No subset of the candidate key should also be a key.
---
##  **Choosing the Primary Key**
- From the **set of candidate keys**, we choose **one** to be the **Primary Key**.
- The chosen key is typically:
    - Easy to remember
    - Short
    - Stable (doesnâ€™t change frequently)
